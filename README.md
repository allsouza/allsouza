## Hi there! :wave:

I am a full-stack software engineer. Ever since my first intro to computer science class in high school, I knew that I wanted to work with technology, using it to make life easier and more productive. Solving problems and simplifying everyday life has always been my passion, and coding gives me the chance to do just that. 

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with family and friends and also hiking the great outdoors.
